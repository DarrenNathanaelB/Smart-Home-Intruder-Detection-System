## Problem

Many homes are vulnerable to intrusion or theft, especially when the owners are away, making home security a top priority. Traditional security systems often fall short for several reasons. They typically lack early warning capabilities, detecting intrusions only after they have started, leading to delayed responses. False alarms are another common issue, often triggered by small animals or environmental disturbances, causing unnecessary inconvenience. Additionally, many traditional systems lack effective visualization and monitoring, failing to provide clear information about the intruder's distance or location. This makes it difficult for homeowners to quickly assess threats and take appropriate action.

## Solution

To address these problem, we developed the Smart Home Intruder Detection System. This device helps users detect movement or objects approaching their homes, notifying homeowners when something nears critical areas like doors or windows. If an object gets close, the system issues audible and visual alerts, displaying the object's distance. If the object comes very near, it escalates the warnings and takes further security measures. The system aims to enhance home security by providing early notifications and preventive actions against potential intrusions.

## Features

- **Motion Detection**: Detects movement near critical areas of the home.
- **Distance Measurement**: Displays the distance of the detected object from the critical areas.
- **Alerts**: Provides audible and visual alerts when an object is detected within a predefined proximity.
- **Preventive Actions**: Implements additional security measures if the object reaches a very close distance.
- **Object Verification**: Ensure object is near the sensor for 5 seconds before alerting.
